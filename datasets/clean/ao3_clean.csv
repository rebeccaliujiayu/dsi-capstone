"First of all, this fic is a so pretentious in all ways. I think you're the only person in this entire fandom who writes wangxian in such a heterosexual way if not extremely yaoi-trope-ish. Secondly, your title? What the fuck. I'm Chinese and it's so fucking funny to me, wrong in all ways and just contextually weird. Thirdly, all the wrongly used palace connotations, please do more research before you even ATTEMPT writing a genre you are not familiar with. Fourthly what the fuck is the characterization? Is this another 50 Shades of Grey wannabe?",1,troll1,0.0,550

"I'm getting a REALLY hard time trying to visualize WWX as a man here because of how feminized you described him. I had to check the tags for heterosexuality but there's none. One thing, author. It can be your personal preference but I think it would be good to tag it properly for those who prefer to read WWX in a not so womanly description. You can write him as a woman in this fic and it wouldn't even feel out of place, but as a man, it feels REALLY out of place.

"The twist was so predictable I could already guessed it's just wwx being dumb and judgemental to have misunderstood a person he supposedly loved and obviously LWJ and LZ are the same people, it's obvious. But I'm disappointed at the lack of clarification on how it happened, there's no buildup to it at all, same goes with the Lans being evil lol. Another thing that made absolutely no sense is why did WWX ask LQY to kiss LZ when LZ already told him he's his true love? WWX should've known LQR wouldn't work, is he that dumb...? There's so many things you described in this fic but what the characters do contradict all of them, that's kinda poor storytelling and confuse people so easily (even though I think your readers most likely don't think hard when they read since you're so infamous for shallow relationship and storytelling). I read this fic with a group of friend because of the premise but we got so disappointed with the blatant copying of the original Maleficent, no creativity at all!",1,troll1,1.0,1002

"Uhm, this fic reads like a Hollywood Mulan? In a way like you tried to incorporate some Chinese period stuff into it but it just... doesn't hit the right spot. It feels very westernized and one can tell from the way you wrote the narration, ESPECIALLY the way you wrote the characters narration. A lot of Chinese values are lost in your writing, and I am saying this as a native mainland Chinese .You seem to be appealing mostly to the Western crowd and you yourself seem to have been influenced by Western upbringing which takes away the immersion of the story, it is as if you are forcing your Westernized idea into what is supposed to be a Chinese setting. The nuance is not there, the characters are thinking in a too-western way, the values, oh boy, the values are all lost. There are too much projections going on here that I just can't indulge in the fic.",1,troll1,0.0,862
This reads like the typical kind of story you find in a collection of English stories about a couple who's getting married. You can simply change the names to someone else and they would fit just fine. There no uniqueness in the way you write WWX and LWJ as if they are just placeholders. I can barely recognize them regardless of whichever chatacterization you took them from. They read very much like two English random peopel to me. Perhaps you should consider writing original stories instead of stealing exposure from the fandom by using characters names that don't even fitwhat you're trying to write.,1,troll1,1.0,607
Cant feel wwx and lwj at all. Very western style of writing. Everything feels western. You might be Chinese but you're possibly influenced by so much western ideas now that everything you write just feels western. It feels hilarious to see you using Chinese titles when you are already long disconnected with your own culture. So pretentious lol.

"Ugh how awful can one fic be? You explored every character except JC and you painted every single one of them as good and only pointed out JC bad sides. What a fucking disgusting story- I want to fuckinv puke just reading it- really hope JC just abandons all of them and its not a reco one but its on the tag- honesrly I expected a bit of wwx's perspective but I didn't expect that it would be all him since you did say that its a reco fic. WN had more screen time than JC- and what's worse is that he was having a good time and that JL was even friends with him. Its almost like the entire fic was written to make WWX look good and for everything to work out for him. Every other character is just there to make him look good. OC disicples who admire him and protect him? Rumor spreading peeps who are there to make him show emotion- JL being a fucking doormat and only having good emotions towards WWX- the only time he has negative emotions is when WWX is there to comfort him and to make himself look like a good uncle- despite being the reason he was an orphan. And of course the ever faithful LZ- and then what Jingyi is there to insult JC so that WWX can defend him and make himself look like he cared? Whats next JC being a doormat and forgiving WWX, inviting him to the home he rebuilt alone? Or JC being a human being and getting mad only for others to defend him and make JC look bad and WWX look like a helpless defenselss uwu baby like the typical wangxian stan you are. Use proper tags- had you tagged it as WWX centric and note that everyone is just there to make him look good- i wouldn't have even thought of reading this- but noooo- you wrote a Yunmeng Reconciliation fic with only WWX's point of view and making all things look good for him. No one adresses the fact that WN had yelled abuse towards JC despite having no right to and despite the fact that JC's entire ancestry had just been insulted. Heck you made JL even a lacky of his. Like eww I hope your not half as disgusting as your story is because most likely you would've caused a new pandemic if you were. Rinse your brain of stupidity and in the first place- you recieved bad comments simply because the story is bullshit- you shouldn't have continued writing it. Even me who never once wrote a comment when I disliked something just had to write something. Ew, just ew.

Worse, making JL go along with it? Like no ones gonna face the consequences of their actions here- its all unicors and rainbows desperately painted grey depsite it not being a sad story at all. Like why? WN has a happy moment and JL gives it to him but JC has no mention here. I hope you don't go through the reconciliation plan- thats the best route for here- hope JC just says its all in the past and leave then to stew in their sins. But then seeing how you're writing if that ever happens- let me guess JL sides with WN and WWX and abandons his uncle? Cause thats just how biased you are? And JC is left alone and dies alone? Thats better than having fake people by his side. There is absolutely no route for reconciliation here because you just spent the entire story painting WWX as a good guy not even a complicated one- just the typical uwu misunderstood good guy- uwu so cute.

You write WWX as if he's struggling- FUCK YOU AND GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF-or stick to writinv porn- you don't have enough braincells to process a stpry when you're only siding with the main character. Oh pooor wwx but then everything he wants falls to his lap and you write him as if he's struggling- oh pooooorr baby- has a legion of juniors to defend him, a husband, he's alive depsite his crimes- oh woe is he who practically has everything- now its JC left and the man, who lost everything, must be the one to do something about WWX's feelings of unrest- oh my gosh WWX has to do all the work here. The worst part is JL really relying on him even though he has his jiujiu- in fact there is no mention of the man unless its convenient for WWX- not for JL. Fuck you bitch go fucking kill yourself- or as i said stick to porn- you're better at it. I don't hate wangxian but the way you write them- worship them- wangxian stans are really the toxic parts of this fandom. We, JL stans may be few, but we know at least that post canon it won't be WWX he'd be relying on- lik what the fuck is wronv with you- why are you so stupid- you should never just have updated this. Better- just delete this or delete yourself. You get a lot of good comments but thats from wangxian stans as blind as you- WWX THE LORD AND SAVIOR stans- please commit suicide and do this world a fucking favor. People would pay for people like you to kill themselves- I'm one of them- but that's a waste of money because cockroaches don't die and thats just unfortunate. JL relying on WWX? What a fucking joke! Like ewwww I wish I never pressed on this- wish I could delete it from my mind. People praising your character developement? It's called OOC- jiujiu was mentioned once in 3 chapters because apparently the murderer of his parents are now JL's entire support system and not the man who raised him.

lxc completely ooc even in modern au? check! meng yao a problem causing toxic slut involved in cheating? check! xiyao with the infidelity norm? check! nmj deserving better from ooc lxc? check! meng yao only referred to as a-yao in the entire fic because of bias? check! wow you got all of them haha,1,troll4,0.0,301

Amazing!

Wonderful! So much easier to shove JGY and LXC into a cringe-inducing relationship when they're forced by a BadGuy^tm into a weird marriage and you toss out half of JGY's canon personality to twist him into being a halfdecent person and don't let the murders and deceit happen ,1,troll4,0.0,279

 wow so along with throwing out any sort of canon compliance you threw out all semblance of established canon personalities for all the characters AND I guess kicked JGS and Qin Su down the stairs and out of the story too for since they don't exist. did JGY killed JGS? Or is he just missing for some magical reason. guessing Qin Su was thrown out the window to shove illogical xiyao together without any obstacles because that's all she is I guess!! also weird how xue yang is so active and XXC isn't coming to stop him. such a bizarre plot it's better off as an original fiction lol,1,troll4,0.0,586
lol I love how all them became progressively more ooc as the story went on to the point where none of them especially nmj were recognizable at the end rofl. that's talent right there to take canon characters and immediately start throwing out more and more of their defined traits to write bizarre situations like that confrontation was pure art in how forced and weird it was lol! . wonder what'll happen when jgy has to marry qin su oh wait its qin su erasure time gg !!,1,troll4,0.0,480

"Normally I am on the side of not leaving criticism unless the content creator asks for it, but this is a case of cultural insensitivity. I am Chinese Han. This work has been getting increasingly culturally tone deaf in the past, like, five chapters? Chinese family dynamics are really hard for westerners to understand so I let it slide, but like. The misplaced colonialist “feminism” in “keeping her maiden name” is just really too blatant. Chinese gender politics certainly has its own problems, but that’s just something grafted willy-nilly from the West without any relevance to the reality of how anything works in Confucianist societies. I was enjoying this work before, but I’m probably not going to read it anymore, personally, and it really pains me that they’re using their platform of a fairly popular fic to spread their misapprehensions about my actual heritage.

Also ""historical accuracy for women's agency"" bitch, stfu, do y'all think being gay was totally cool and normal and kosher in Han-era China? Cause history screams no and nowadays even less so thanks to Communism. So shut your mouths.

The reason Wei Ying returned... yeah characters in that universe suffered way too many tragedies, it was an unbelievable amount in my little opinion. I totally understand that him being happy and not his brother would cause him to return. Though keeping so many others alive who deserve to be alive would be a bonus.

Those poor cultivators that had to witness that, though, they did kinda deserve it. Also, the way Wen Qing helped was genius and poor Wen Ning, that cinnamon roll is the perfect sect leader to show how vastly different the sect can be to how it was under Wen Ruohan.
With how much more the female parts of the Jiang family know, one could get the feeling that it is a secret matriarchy.

"Now this, I'd say, is the least ooc that bottom lwj has ever been. I believe bottom lwj is very much possible and capable of being hot as all hell but I'm always disappointed with how authors change so much of his actual persona to make him fit the role. And like, I get it. It's incredibly difficult to write his character even without the sexual aspect of him so ofc it's got to be hard shit to write him sexually when canon is completely against bottom lwj. BUT I'd prefer the authors to at least be honest about it and tag him as ooc which is very rarely done, so this one, with no requirement of the tag AND lwj and wwx as canon as ever, was a whole delight.

I really love this fic. It’s one of the very few unfinished fics that I actively go back and reread. Looking forward to the next chapter whenever you have a chance to post.,0,,,172
I'm so sorry about the negative comments <3 this fic is lovely and I've had such a nice time reading it,0,,,103
"Life is hard (especially given everything) and fic writing is hard too! Kudos to you for wanting to continue this, and I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with such negativity. Ugh the JC reveal was so good and set up the parallels in both of their sacrifices (including the way WWX talks about JC daring to hide it from him - god they’re both idiots and I love them). It’s going to be so interesting when they meet again.",0,,,419
"Oh holy moly this was amazing I was initially gonna wait for the next part to come before I started this, but the description was too interesting for me to pass on and here I am Loved it!",0,,,194
"The way I jumped when I saw the AO3 email. God, this has been such a ride! I'm so excited for the two of them! ",0,,,117
"I love how shy JC is! But he is still so good for his Huan-gege.
Your style of writing is very captivating! Looking forward to new chapter ️️",0,,,143
This was absolutely fantastic. Excited for the next chapter! Thanks for sharing. ,0,,,81
"Wow! Once again you've done it. These 3 chapters were intense. Also, JC's need to self-immolate is bordering on masochism. I mean, you were granted a gift to change not only yourself but in some sense, your past mistakes yet his ridiculously low insecurity prevents him from doing it. I mean c'mon. It's pathetic. Reading this last chapter, I just wanted to shake him and scream ""get your head out the sand and go and grab your destiny"". Ugh. Anyway, thank you for your story",0,,,475
good..finally u dump those ungrateful n toxic people in ur fam..now lets see if they can run the business like usual or loose all the sales n etc..i hope that wwx will ruin n bamkruot the company to the point of bankruptcy n close it down..coz jc n the nies will not go n buy it off from dem to take over..let someone else do it..,0,,,330
"I’ve read the whole series and I have so much emotions now I can not explain. (Add to that that horrible donhua huh) I wanna punch WWX and LWJ so bad. So so bad. Sorry, but ADHD isn’t excuse for being an asshole brother. JFM must die the most horrible death. He must DIE. NMJ and JC do not deserve that kind of the mess. Honestly, NMJ being an angel keeping up with all this bullshit of Jiangs household. No wonder he needed therapy too. I want them to have a happy ending. I want all other suffer immensely. Yesimmathatbitterbitch. That’s wonderful how you managed to portray all of it so realistically. How dysfunctional family poisons everything surrounding it. That wow. True talent. Thank you ",0,,,704
wow..u locked n ignored jc out from his own home..in the rain..n den go n run to lwj uses him as a rebound..ugh..wretched brat..,0,,,128
"Oh, bitch nah!
Wtf wwx, isn’t jc your bf? The hell are you doing going around, fucking another guy? I mean really? Without even attempting to talk it out with jc? My god, why are you like this?",0,,,193
"Nope. No sympathy fo Jiang Wanyin and Jiang Yanli either. Idk what they did or didn’t know. Are you telling me Jiang Wanyin, eventually growing into an adult, never looked into the specifics of his medical record? And if Jiang Yanli is so great, she wouldn’t always be such a disappointing character in canon and fanon. “I didn’t know, I’m sorry, let me make some soup, busy marrying the man of my dreams so I couldn’t have done anything about your suffering” whatever
Lol I’m honestly not a big fan of Yanli so if I were Lan Zhan, I’d tell Wei Ying what happened. And if I were Wei Ying, I’d hit IGNORE. Passsssssss
I also realize that I’m being super harsh but let me live out my fictional RAGE",0,,,697
Excuse me while i burn a-cheng's parent's house down I fucking hate them..My poor baby A-cheng and you have an incredible talent and this fic is amazingly written And i know I'm late but i hope you are feeling better luv.I wish i could come come over and listen to all your problems or just give you a hug.I really do Take care author.Love you ,0,,,354
"Hey, thanks for sharing your work with us! Some of the stuff that was mentioned about it being ok to not know what you want and the feelings of being lost in terms about who you are, really hit home for me, but I never really knew how to articulte those feelings Side note, I'm really sorry to hear that you're having a rough day. Hope that you're feeling better now and please take care of yourself! (drink lots of water and take nice long naps)",0,,,447
"This was so good its almost like... bittersweet in a way? And I appreciate that love isnt some automatic cure, but it certainly helps make everything a little bit better (and I hope one day you (really, all of us lmao) get an lxc of your own)
I'm sorry that you had such a bad day and I hope you feel better and that venting like this helped some <3 it's okay to not know who you are, and to take some time to try to establish who you want to be and what you want from life, away from the influences of other people, including your parents and those you want to please (and trying to come to terms with the fact that you being happy and satisfied and content is more important than making everyone else around you happy and trying to make them proud of you, and that there are ppl in your life who love you regardless of what you can do for them and will be proud of you for finding yourself(I... haven't quite achieved this lol))
Stay healthy and safe! I hope you have a better day today Also I love Over and epik high omg and it suits jc so well?? I never realized wow",0,,,1077
"I'm so glad they resolved all misunderstandings and ended up together!
Thank you for writing this story ",0,,,106
"Thank you for sharing this amazing fic, I enjoyed reading it a lot and I appreciate the extra work putting in it by adding the images as well Good job fixing your relationship by your drunk twittering, jc, huan-ge deserves all your love, spoil him! ",0,,,255
"
Awwwwwwwwwww!",0,,,14
"
omg cries LOVELY ENDING FOR THE LOVELIEST PEOPLE",0,,,49
"Awww very sweet ending, loved this! Thanks so much for sharing~!",0,,,64
"oh!!!!!!
this really had an interesting writing style and sequences, and i do feel really intrigued by this plot and the way it was written out. and the ending!!!
it really hit the peak!!",0,,,188
"This is very poignant. He starts out trying to undo what he did then just finds himself doing his best to get home to the person who matters most. And all the versions he meets, just as tragic, make him more determined. Love it.",0,,,228
"This is so terribly, hauntingly beautiful. I love this to absolute pieces. I love the open ending, how over time Wei Wuxian slowly comes to realise that even if they can not live what they had dreamt of, what they felt for each other won't be devalued and remains just as precious. There are so many brilliant phrases here. Your writing style is lovely. But especially the two ending lines of each of the quote-styled portions. All of them are amazing. Thank you so much for this gem of a piece.",0,,,496
Aww the dimension hopping one!,0,,,30
"
Oooh exciting! I can't wait to see where the rest of this story goes ",0,,,72
"
They had a CHAINSAW attached to their HAND and then used a STEEL CABLE like a WHIP????
This is the content I live and breathe for, tyvm",0,,,136
"
This was so heartwarming <3",0,,,28
Alien world seems deeply unpleasant. I'd also jump into a weird rift to escape it ><,0,,,84
"
DETONATE THE BREACH!!!!!!
Also the image of wangxian just covered in whatever pickled kaiju body parts xue yang had is kind of funny",0,,,133
"Yes good perfect. Happy ending. Amazing. I really enjoyed this, thanks so much for sharing ",0,,,93
"hhahahahaha OMG THIS IS THE BEEEEEEEEEEST!!
LOOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT ALL!!
fengmian really see that coming and still there is nothing he can do about it!!
thanks for sharing! cant wait for more!",0,,,200
"This made me cackle. My cheeks hurt because I had a smile the whole time I was reading. I can’t even say what parts are my favorite because every time I decide, I read something funnier. JFM sitting up in bed in a cold sweat friggin kills me ",0,,,244
"
I saw your username and i click
I love this its so cute
Can you blame them tho, a-cheng is cute",0,,,96
"
yes they won't let him fall prey to the sharks in the ocean ",0,,,63
"It is a credit to your skills as a writer that you had me smiling,
laughing, and THOROUGHLY engrossed in a fic that wasn't Wangxian centric. Kudos and thank you.",0,,,162
hahhahah thank gods for yzy for having the brain in the family!!!,0,,,65
"
SCREAMS THE DAD-SON RECONCILATION IS AMAZING JDJDJDJDDHDHDDB i love this so much!!!!!!!!!",0,,,91
"This was beautiful and and I'm glad that LXC joined forces with WWX and JFM. This is the only JFM that I like, other than that the canon JFM can go fuck himself. Take care, drink some water, and have a nicd day/night!!",0,,,220
"I had SO MUCH fun with this, and I love how you closed it. Full circle.
People hate JFM? I haven't been that long in the fandom so I wouldn't know. It seems rather unfair, I mean obviously he had his flaws but I don't think he is hateful. Besides, a common theme in mxtx's works is that flaws are inevitable in anyone",0,,,317
"I literally laughed out loud several times while reading this, I think it cured my depression. ",0,,,98
Oh this is too wonderful AND THE ENDING..???? THAT PHONE CALL?? HAHAHAHA ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! What a good ending hahahahahaha thank you for this!!! I had so so so much fun reading this,0,,,185
Great beginning. Looking forward to more,0,,,40
"oooh long fic and slowburn? super excited for this! love the first chapter, can't wait for the next!",0,,,101
"I am loving this! I don't always get in on the ground floor for an epic like this, but this concept is pushing all the right buttons, so I am all in! Super excited to join you on this epic journey of slowburn and, I can only hope, copious mutual pining (which is my jam).",0,,,271
"
