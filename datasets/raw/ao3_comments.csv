"First of all, this fic is a so pretentious in all ways. I think you're the only person in this entire fandom who writes wangxian in such a heterosexual way if not extremely yaoi-trope-ish. Secondly, your title? What the fuck. I'm Chinese and it's so fucking funny to me, wrong in all ways and just contextually weird. Thirdly, all the wrongly used palace connotations, please do more research before you even ATTEMPT writing a genre you are not familiar with. Fourthly what the fuck is the characterization? Is this another 50 Shades of Grey wannabe?",1,troll1,0
"Sally I was so excited for your emperorji fic but I'm so sorry your characterization this time threw me off so badly, I'll have to pass >.<",1,troll1,0
"Huh, I thought you're always ""follow mxtx's rules!"" just to pull this concubine thing.......... it's okay if you have your preferred WangXian but don't be a hypocrite",1,troll1,0
Came in expecting a good research of palace fic. I even tried to close an eye on the emperor x concubine thing but even the palace convention is all wrong. Dropped.,1,troll1,0
"OH ARE THESE WANGXIAN? I thought I was reading a fic from a wrong fandom. The characters feel so different!

Sorry, dropped.",1,troll1,1

"I'm getting a REALLY hard time trying to visualize WWX as a man here because of how feminized you described him. I had to check the tags for heterosexuality but there's none. One thing, author. It can be your personal preference but I think it would be good to tag it properly for those who prefer to read WWX in a not so womanly description. You can write him as a woman in this fic and it wouldn't even feel out of place, but as a man, it feels REALLY out of place. It is better to add a disclaimer if not the fic feels like your a fetishising men.",1,troll1,0
Oh I see you know Chinese. It feels 娘娘腔 for the lack of better words.,1,troll1,0
But this author is so ooc I usually pretend I'm reading an og story because there's literally no resemblance to the og wangxian at all 😅,1,troll1,1
"I'M SO EXCITED TO READ THIS BECAUSE IT'S A MALEFICENT AU ONE OF MY FAVORITE!! BUT!!!!! The characterization is so bad it's so OOC that I feel like reading a Disney fanfic instead, it keeps breaking my immersions, why does LWJ speak so much and why does WWX act like a Disney OC princess... 😢",1,troll1,1
"All these whitewashing.............. hilarious you call yourself a chinese when you can't even differentiate between a western dragon and oriential dragon and it shows. please stfu if you don't know better instead of spreading misinformation, be a fucking responsible adult.",1,troll1,1
HOLY FUCK WWX IS SO FUCKING DUMB 🤣 WHAT A CLOWN 🤣,1,troll1,1
Can you please not tag WangXian :/ it's a waste of time reading this. Please do not bait people with misleading tags :/,1,troll1,1
"I'm so upset you hurt not only wangxian but LXC as well in your writing, what the fuck is this bullshit? The way wangxian are both so despicable because of your bullshit ""wangxian supremacy"" WHILE HURTING OTHER PEOPLE because oh it's all fun and games for them. The wangxian you write are SCUMS that their original selves would WHOLLY DESPISE. And you FUCKING SALLY, is the WORST SCUM of them all. I hope you never get laid your whole time, you homophobic fetishizer.",1,troll1,1
Please tag dark!LWJ and female!WWX. I have both tags blocked and it ruined my day seeing this in the tags :(,1,troll1,0
"Hi, can you please tag dark!LWJ and wife!WWX? Need to have this blocked. Thanks :)",1,troll1,1
DAMN I will freak out if I know someone like LWJ. Was so excited to read his POV but he's such a CREEP. This is unhealthy obsession oh GOD.,1,troll1,1
Cant accept wwx cheating a marriage on lwj the same way your lwj did to wwx in palace au. Such a disservice to their characters ugh.,1,troll1,0
Genuinely disgusted by LWJ EW what the FUCK SHSMS,1,troll1,1
Did you self-insert into wwx so much that you just let him marry without an explanation of if he's even in love 🤪,1,troll1,1
"Huh.... Isn't the reason WWX likes LWJ is BECAUSE he's not a yandere? ""Want to bring someone back, but he does not want it"" LOL read lesser fanfics 😂",1,troll1,1
.....how does the dragon blood thingy work? It....doesn't make sense? It's the only thing bugging me in this fic and IMO it kind of ruined the whole thing......,1,troll1,1
"Tried really hard to like this fic since you have a nice writing style but erm.
LWJ aside, your WWX is very...feminine? ""His"" body language and dialogues and the position you put him in make it very hard to imagine him as WWX. I've dropped out of immersion too many times to count, it honestly feels like a projection of a typical female character or a typical uke character from stereotypical yaoi tropes.",1,troll1,1
"Heaven's Will what 🤣
The romance is kinda forced but the Heaven's Will totally broke me, well done 🤣",1,troll1,1
"Felt rushed. But other than that, a pretty okay story :)",1,troll1,1
"Have been looking forward to this chapter! Thank you! Ive been trying to put my hands on why I feel out of place and it could be the abrupt plot device you added? It gives a feeling as if you just only cooked these up without proper feeling in advance and thus makes it feel out of nowhere, felt forced just for the angst (if that's your intent?). It kinds broke the immersion but other than that, thank you!",1,troll1,1
"Hm, something I can't make sense is how is wwx's strength incompatible to his personality? I can't quite imagine how he can be so submissive when he should be inherently strong. I feel you might want to present power wwx but it still feels too forced :/",1,troll1,1
"Ah damn, I had too high of an expectation when you said you were low-key sobbing but it felt anti-climatic to me, and I only have myself to blame... I was expecting more but... you don't mean the sobbing as to what happened to LJY, right...?",1,troll1,1
Isn't a yuan supposed to be a Wen? did you stripe him off his ancestry 🤣,1,troll1,1
I find it ooc for wwx to let lan yuan call him a-niang? Didn't he say he didn't like it in the novel?,1,troll1,1
Still confused how LWJ and WWX fall for each other. WWX is... Stockholm Syndome? What about LWJ? Because WWX is pretty?,1,troll1,1
"The romance felt...forced? I can't explain, but it falls short a lot in this story. I can barely feel anything between them.",1,troll1,1
Would like it better if LWJ didn't get nerfed just to power up WWX....,1,troll1,1
"The twist was so predictable I could already guessed it's just wwx being dumb and judgemental to have misunderstood a person he supposedly loved 🙄 and obviously LWJ and LZ are the same people, it's obvious. But I'm disappointed at the lack of clarification on how it happened, there's no buildup to it at all, same goes with the Lans being evil lol. Another thing that made absolutely no sense is why did WWX ask LQY to kiss LZ when LZ already told him he's his true love? WWX should've known LQR wouldn't work, is he that dumb...? There's so many things you described in this fic but what the characters do contradict all of them, that's kinda poor storytelling and confuse people so easily (even though I think your readers most likely don't think hard when they read since you're so infamous for shallow relationship and storytelling). I read this fic with a group of friend because of the premise but we got so disappointed with the blatant copying of the original Maleficent, no creativity at all!",1,troll1,1
"Came in to read WangXian, but the characters feel like Disney characters instead it makes wonder if I'm reading WangXian or a Disney book 🤣 LZ feels so much like a typical Disney prince than being LZ, WWX is just your typical damsel Disney princess too 🤣",1,troll1,1
Can you please tag dark LWJ and tape and non con and feminization 🙄,1,troll1,1
At this point I'm convinced you have forgotten all about mdzs canon 🤣,1,troll1,1
"Uhm, this fic reads like a Hollywood Mulan? In a way like you tried to incorporate some Chinese period stuff into it but it just... doesn't hit the right spot. It feels very westernized and one can tell from the way you wrote the narration, ESPECIALLY the way you wrote the characters narration. A lot of Chinese values are lost in your writing, and I am saying this as a native mainland Chinese .You seem to be appealing mostly to the Western crowd and you yourself seem to have been influenced by Western upbringing which takes away the immersion of the story, it is as if you are forcing your Westernized idea into what is supposed to be a Chinese setting. The nuance is not there, the characters are thinking in a too-western way, the values, oh boy, the values are all lost. There are too much projections going on here that I just can't indulge in the fic.",1,troll1,0
This reads like the typical kind of story you find in a collection of English stories about a couple who's getting married. You can simply change the names to someone else and they would fit just fine. There no uniqueness in the way you write WWX and LWJ as if they are just placeholders. I can barely recognize them regardless of whichever chatacterization you took them from. They read very much like two English random peopel to me. Perhaps you should consider writing original stories instead of stealing exposure from the fandom by using characters names that don't even fitwhat you're trying to write.,1,troll1,1
Cant feel wwx and lwj at all. Very western style of writing. Everything feels western. You might be Chinese but you're possibly influenced by so much western ideas now that everything you write just feels western. It feels hilarious to see you using Chinese titles when you are already long disconnected with your own culture. So pretentious lol. And of course your 腿毛 will defend you. 作文？笑死了，一看这用词就知道对中文一知半解还敢拿出来秀，脸皮厚也有个限度吧，我这个华人看着都为你尴尬😅,1,troll1,1
Was wondering why is this fic so ooc just to realize it had the novel tagged. Can you not tag the novel? It's misleading and tricking people into wasting time reading something that is completely not what they are looking for.,1,troll1,0
can you not tag this as the novel. I came in for the novel characterization just to see how ooc it is. Same goes to your other fics. Please get out of the novel tag and leave it as CQL only. They're two different things. Thanks.,1,troll1,0
"As a chinese I can't help but feel second hand embarrassment for  you because you chinese is so... broken. Even the way you try to incorporate the idioms feel so out of place, and you clearly don't know a lot about the genre to be writing this and it shows. Knowing chinese doesn't mean you know the genre, author, at the very least don't spread misinformation.",1,troll1,0
"OH GOD can you not tag this as mdzs???? The characterizations are all wrong, please stop baiting people who only want to read mdzs characters JEEZ",1,troll1,0
"Your lwj is kinda... ooc? he turned flat into a typical character you can easily find in any English shows, pretty much lost his own nuance :/

Also you shouldn't tag WangXian if they are not going to end up together...",1,troll1,1

Self centered people writing a story centered on one person but affects a lot of people- using only one point of view- great just great.

jc gonna come out next- suddenly realizing that he should just forgive and then inviting wx to lp so that they could disrespect him more- jc begging for forgiveness for whatever sins u people think he committed- jc being a stepping stool to make the mains look good- what a great read

Put JC bashing in ur tags, wwx centric, jl bashing, canon divergence where u disregard the entire relationship of jl and jc, and the relationship between jc and yunmenh jiang cause apparently the next ur gonna do is make wwx the next sect leader. And put wwx worshipper- wouldn't have come across this if only u had tagged appropriately",1,troll2,0

So JL just suddenly calls wwx uncle- wow you're characters really are just here to make the main look good.

"Ugh how awful can one fic be?

You explored every character except JC and you painted every single one of them as good and only pointed out JC bad sides. What a fucking disgusting story- I want to fuckinv puke just reading it- really hope JC just abandons all of them and its not a reco one but its on the tag- honesrly I expected a bit of wwx's perspective but I didn't expect that it would be all him since you did say that its a reco fic. WN had more screen time than JC- and what's worse is that he was having a good time and that JL was even friends with him. Its almost like the entire fic was written to make WWX look good and for everything to work out for him. Every other character is just there to make him look good.

OC disicples who admire him and protect him? Rumor spreading peeps who are there to make him show emotion- JL being a fucking doormat and only having good emotions towards WWX- the only time he has negative emotions is when WWX is there to comfort him and to make himself look like a good uncle- despite being the reason he was an orphan. And of course the ever faithful LZ- and then what Jingyi is there to insult JC so that WWX can defend him and make himself look like he cared?

Whats next JC being a doormat and forgiving WWX, inviting him to the home he rebuilt alone? Or JC being a human being and getting mad only for others to defend him and make JC look bad and WWX look like a helpless defenselss uwu baby like the typical wangxian stan you are. Use proper tags- had you tagged it as WWX centric and note that everyone is just there to make him look good- i wouldn't have even thought of reading this- but noooo- you wrote a Yunmeng Reconciliation fic with only WWX's point of view and making all things look good for him.

No one adresses the fact that WN had yelled abuse towards JC despite having no right to and despite the fact that JC's entire ancestry had just been insulted. Heck you made JL even a lacky of his. Like eww I hope your not half as disgusting as your story is because most likely you would've caused a new pandemic if you were.

Rinse your brain of stupidity and in the first place- you recieved bad comments simply because the story is bullshit- you shouldn't have continued writing it. Even me who never once wrote a comment when I disliked something just had to write something.

Ew, just ew. Arrange your tags and note that despite having a fic centered on the main characters- you only have a few hits- a few kudos- and loots of comments. Think.",1,troll2,0
"Reread this again and its still as awful as it was- worse it got updated. Wen Ning was a rude ass bitch who had no right to do what he did but then you write him as someone who deserves something? Worse, making JL go along with it?

Like no ones gonna face the consequences of their actions here- its all unicors and rainbows desperately painted grey depsite it not being a sad story at all. Like why? WN has a happy moment and JL gives it to him but JC has no mention here.

I hope you don't go through the reconciliation plan- thats the best route for here- hope JC just says its all in the past and leave then to stew in their sins. But then seeing how you're writing if that ever happens- let me guess JL sides with WN and WWX and abandons his uncle? Cause thats just how biased you are? And JC is left alone and dies alone? Thats better than having fake people by his side.

There is absolutely no route for reconciliation here because you just spent the entire story painting WWX as a good guy not even a complicated one- just the typical uwu misunderstood good guy- uwu so cute.

What a fucking joke for a fic- delete my comment if you want- no changing that its true.",1,troll2,0
"Saw this on twitter and had wanted to read it since it was you- an author I'm already familiar with and one I know isn't a JC hater- at least I thought you weren't but then you proved me wrong by writing this fucking bullshit!!!! JC raised JL but suddenly he's abandoned for THE SAINT AND SAVIOUR WEI WUXIAN YAY THE MAN COULD DO NOW WRONG AND IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT- not the man who killed his parents- no complicated feelings whatsoever. You write WWX as if he's struggling- FUCK YOU AND GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF-or stick to writinv porn- you don't have enough braincells to process a stpry when you're only siding with the main character. Oh pooor wwx but then everything he wants falls to his lap and you write him as if he's struggling- oh pooooorr baby- has a legion of juniors to defend him, a husband, he's alive depsite his crimes- oh woe is he who practically has everything- now its JC left and the man, who lost everything, must be the one to do something about WWX's feelings of unrest- oh my gosh WWX has to do all the work here.

The worst part is JL really relying on him even though he has his jiujiu- in fact there is no mention of the man unless its convenient for WWX- not for JL.

Fuck you bitch go fucking kill yourself- or as i said stick to porn- you're better at it. I don't hate wangxian but the way you write them- worship them- wangxian stans are really the toxic parts of this fandom. We, JL stans may be few, but we know at least that post canon it won't be WWX he'd be relying on- lik what the fuck is wronv with you- why are you so stupid- you should never just have updated this. Better- just delete this or delete yourself.

You get a lot of good comments but thats from wangxian stans as blind as you- WWX THE LORD AND SAVIOR stans- please commit suicide and do this world a fucking favor.

People would pay for people like you to kill themselves- I'm one of them- but that's a waste of money because cockroaches don't die and thats just unfortunate.

JL relying on WWX? What a fucking joke! Like ewwww I wish I never pressed on this- wish I could delete it from my mind. People praising your character developement? It's called OOC- jiujiu was mentioned once in 3 chapters because apparently the murderer of his parents are now JL's entire support system and not the man who raised him.

FUCK YOU KILL YOURSELF- I HOPE YOU DO THIS WORLD A FAVOR.",1,troll2,0
"does it really count as a full account, though, if the reason jiang cheng lost his core was not revealed? ultimately though i understand understand what you were trying to portray i still feel like this comes across as biased towards lwj and wwx - after all, jiang cheng ended up having to reveal the core transfer to the general public and publicly forgive wwx for his crimes against him, and lwj does not even have the face to apologize out loud!

Wonderful! So much easier to shove JGY and LXC into a cringe-inducing relationship when they're forced by a BadGuy^tm into a weird marriage and you toss out half of JGY's canon personality to twist him into being a halfdecent person and don't let the murders and deceit happen XD,1,troll4,0
"everyone super ooc and acting in illogical and bizarre ways, characters alive when they should be dead, jgy suddenly becoming a suicidal angsty teenage girl, ahaha wow this makes no sense as a mdzs fanfic. should have just wrote original content XD",1,troll4,0
I like your mary sue meng yao :D,1,troll4,0
"Ah what a wonderful snippet of a bland fluffy modern au, a nice tribute to the fake niceness of JGY and LXC's friendship in canon, how everything nice about it was false and pretend. :) Kudos! Though you should try your hand at original fiction since the MDZS character names make little sense here with how little semblance to the canon characters there is. :D",1,troll4,0
masterful example of taking established canon personalities and throwing them out the window. top tier ooc great job!,1,troll4,0
XD wow so along with throwing out any sort of canon compliance you threw out all semblance of established canon personalities for all the characters AND I guess kicked JGS and Qin Su down the stairs and out of the story too for since they don't exist. did JGY killed JGS? Or is he just missing for some magical reason. guessing Qin Su was thrown out the window to shove illogical xiyao together without any obstacles because that's all she is I guess!! also weird how xue yang is so active and XXC isn't coming to stop him. such a bizarre plot it's better off as an original fiction lol,1,troll4,0
lol I love how all them became progressively more ooc as the story went on to the point where none of them especially nmj were recognizable at the end rofl. XD that's talent right there to take canon characters and immediately start throwing out more and more of their defined traits to write bizarre situations like that confrontation was pure art in how forced and weird it was lol! XD . wonder what'll happen when jgy has to marry qin su oh wait its qin su erasure time gg XD!!,1,troll4,0
"This story had a promising start, but thanks to this chapter alone it’s gone to shit tbqh. If you aren’t going to put any effort into a chapter, don’t bother updating at all.",1,troll4,0
lol wow love how you completely gutted their canon personalities to write this au! great job! :D :D :D,1,troll4,0
Fantastic self-insert where you could shove all your favorite pairings together no matter how illogical and change the plot to suit your own fantasies :D,1,troll4,0
"so it's been 100 years since the tomb was sealed for 100 years? wow ok, and jgy was cheating on poor qin su? XD XD wow amazing how ooc lxc is in this story, wishing for his abuser to come back and manipulate him into a toxic relationship again and maybe murder another sworn brother?? XD XD XD lol even funnier is lxc believing jgy never meant to hurt him when jgy lied to his face for so many years and attempted to have lwj and other lan sect members killed at the second siege rofl. excellent demonstration of illogical oocness in this story, fantastic",1,troll4,0
lol congrats on finishing meng yao the mary sue The Fic. XD never seen such a bland story with such a convenient murder getaway before. yawn XD maybe you can write something different in the future that isnt just a rehash of all your story plots XD XD,1,troll4,0
Go full on sad end and have jgy kill himself,1,troll4,0
lol XD what a hasty forced drama free unrealistic wrap up regarding jgy being a piece of shit slut and lxc being full on bizzarro land ooc but i guess that suits this fic haha,1,troll4,0
cool idea too bad xiyao is including. too toxic and gross :P,1,troll4,0
lol two toxic pairings xiyao and xuexiao barf,1,troll4,0
I hope lan-furen dies. he's disgusting,1,troll4,0
You have the weirdest fetish for Lan Xichen in particular getting raped. Maybe seek some therapy.,1,troll4,0
wow great story where all logic and canon characterization are thrown out the window to save an irredeemable lying murdering rat and force him into an unhealthy relationship with the poor man he abused and lied to for years XD,1,troll4,0
how much time of your life did you waste writing almost 100k words of this boring fic?,1,troll4,0
"Eew too bad gross ooc 3zun ruins the fic. Was pretty good wangxian but barf having to read ""a-yao"" all the time instead of his actual full name but hey that's ooc for you",1,troll4,0
"That was an interesting read of a twisted unhealthy, borderline abusive, relationship with one IC character and one ooc character. Cool story lol",1,troll4,0

"Normally I am on the side of not leaving criticism unless the content creator asks for it, but this is a case of cultural insensitivity. I am Chinese Han. This work has been getting increasingly culturally tone deaf in the past, like, five chapters? Chinese family dynamics are really hard for westerners to understand so I let it slide, but like. The misplaced colonialist “feminism” in “keeping her maiden name” is just really too blatant. Chinese gender politics certainly has its own problems, but that’s just something grafted willy-nilly from the West without any relevance to the reality of how anything works in Confucianist societies. I was enjoying this work before, but I’m probably not going to read it anymore, personally, and it really pains me that they’re using their platform of a fairly popular fic to spread their misapprehensions about my actual heritage.

"Oof. Lan Qiren really stepping out of line with that one. Tbh it's the kind of thing I can see him thinking. The Lan sect rules remind me a lot of Vulcan culture and it inevitably leads to the same sense of superiority in some of it's members.
I like what you did with Jiang Yanli! This is why it's so important to frame learning in terms of a student's strengths and interests.
Thanks for sharing your writing!",0,,
"Ho.Ly. Frick. I've been following this series for some time now, and had noticed your notes on other chapters, I hadn't been able to read this work until now. I am so sorry you went through that horrific, senseless smear campaign. This series is just. . . . a gift, and I'm truly grateful you didn't let a bunch of a**holes silence you.",0,,

"Okay before I read the fic: people are having at you for ""historical accuracy""???? Over a fanfic for a xianxian novel? Do we NEED to go back to Fanfiction.net's ""Don't like, don't read"" disclaimer in 2020? You fucking idiots?

Also ""historical accuracy for women's agency"" bitch, stfu, do y'all think being gay was totally cool and normal and kosher in Han-era China? Cause history screams no and nowadays even less so thanks to Communism. So shut your mouths. The original author herself played fast and loose and barely paid attention to the females in the cast (because MDZS is a GAY NOVEL) so mind your damn business. MDZS is literally not historically accurate in any way so why should the fanfic author have to bear the brunt?",0,,
"I love seeing the commentary for this chapter, it’s SO good — the creeping wrongness! the TWIST, oh man!!!!",0,,

And Wei Wuxian has no room to talk. Kissing Lan Zhan before they were married and he objects to Yanli and Zixuan only walking with each other, honestly.",0,,

I'm sorry that you have been getting a lot of bs by people, you don't deserve it. This is a wonderful story and so well developed, one of my favorites. You are the author. You have the right to write as you please, especially when it comes to fanfics and people need to remember that.
Thank you for this fantastic fanfic!",0,,
"Thank you. Another brilliant chapter.

I shed tears reading this chapter, it was so emotionally charged. I’m so glad Wei Ying’s PTSD was recognized and Wen Qing began healing his emotional state.

The reason Wei Ying returned... yeah characters in that universe suffered way too many tragedies, it was an unbelievable amount in my little opinion. I totally understand that him being happy and not his brother would cause him to return. Though keeping so many others alive who deserve to be alive would be a bonus.
<3",0,,
"Thank you. Another well written chapter.

Jin ZiXun asked to be slaughtered and he was, thank you for granting his wish. Good riddance. How dare those idiots torment Wei Ying, how dare they!!!!

Wei Ying has regressed and it brought tears to my eyes. I can now only hope for his healing to begin.

I really, really love the image of the rings of cultivators, as concentric rings of caring community, filtering through Lan Wangji and Jiang Cheng as the two people who love Wei Wuxian most.

In particular, I love all of the work you've done to develop and bring the motivations of Jiang Cheng (my poor salty darling) to light.

And now, I'm going to go back and reread this from the beginning!",0,,
Its so nice to see the jin sect flourish under new management. And lan zhan and jiang yanli double teaming jin zixun was hilarious. Chefs kiss,0,,
A-Yuan!! You cute baby!!!! Little radish A-Yuan!!! 😭😭😭😭😭,0,,
"Nice chapter! It was very cute how A-Yuan could literally reverse Wei Wuxian's temper. I guess, he must have been anxious to get to his son. Also, the kiss was fun. Those poor cultivators that had to witness that, though, they did kinda deserve it. Also, the way Wen Qing helped was genius and poor Wen Ning, that cinnamon roll is the perfect sect leader to show how vastly different the sect can be to how it was under Wen Ruohan.
With how much more the female parts of the Jiang family know, one could get the feeling that it is a secret matriarchy.
Thank you for updating!",0,,
"""Maybe later, he sighs. Maybe after the war. Maybe this time, they can find peace."" Wait no, now I'm nervous. Thanks for the chapter!",0,,

"Gosh I just LOVE this. Like. Damn. So much drama.

The way Wei Wuxian enters the cave and FEELS the resentment. How his kind bleeding heart makes him promise to help. Jin Zixuan showing some better character development already compared to canon. MianMian being sweetly awesome. The whole damn BATTLE.

-hands over platter- Magic cupcakes for you!",0,,
"Now this, I'd say, is the least ooc that bottom lwj has ever been. I believe bottom lwj is very much possible and capable of being hot as all hell but I'm always disappointed with how authors change so much of his actual persona to make him fit the role. And like, I get it. It's incredibly difficult to write his character even without the sexual aspect of him so ofc it's got to be hard shit to write him sexually when canon is completely against bottom lwj. BUT I'd prefer the authors to at least be honest about it and tag him as ooc which is very rarely done, so this one, with no requirement of the tag AND lwj and wwx as canon as ever, was a whole delight. Thank you for this gem ♡",0,,

"Wow! Once again you've done it. These 3 chapters were intense. Also, JC's need to self-immolate is bordering on masochism. I mean, you were granted a gift to change not only yourself but in some sense, your past mistakes yet his ridiculously low insecurity prevents him from doing it. I mean c'mon. It's pathetic. Reading this last chapter, I just wanted to shake him and scream ""get your head out the sand and go and grab your destiny"". Ugh. Anyway, thank you for your story",0,,
good..finally u dump those ungrateful n toxic people in ur fam..now lets see if they can run the business like usual or loose all the sales n etc..i hope that wwx will ruin n bamkruot the company to the point of bankruptcy n close it down..coz jc n the nies will not go n buy it off from dem to take over..let someone else do it..,0,,

JFM must die the most horrible death. He must DIE.

NMJ and JC do not deserve that kind of the mess. Honestly, NMJ being an angel keeping up with all this bullshit of Jiangs household. No wonder he needed therapy too.

I want them to have a happy ending. I want all other suffer immensely. Yesimmathatbitterbitch.

And if Jiang Yanli is so great, she wouldn’t always be such a disappointing character in canon and fanon. “I didn’t know, I’m sorry, let me make some soup, busy marrying the man of my dreams so I couldn’t have done anything about your suffering” whatever🌚
Lol I’m honestly not a big fan of Yanli so if I were Lan Zhan, I’d tell Wei Ying what happened. And if I were Wei Ying, I’d hit IGNORE. Passsssssss
I also realize that I’m being super harsh but let me live out my fictional RAGE",0,,
Excuse me while i burn a-cheng's parent's house down😐 I fucking hate them..My poor baby A-cheng 🥺💜 and you have an incredible talent and this fic is amazingly written 💜And i know I'm late but i hope you are feeling better luv.I wish i could come come over and listen to all your problems or just give you a hug.I really do💜💜💜💜 Take care author.Love you 💜,0,,
"Hey, thanks for sharing your work with us! Some of the stuff that was mentioned about it being ok to not know what you want and the feelings of being lost in terms about who you are, really hit home for me, but I never really knew how to articulte those feelings

Side note, I'm really sorry to hear that you're having a rough day. Hope that you're feeling better now and please take care of yourself! (drink lots of water and take nice long naps)",0,,
"This was so good ;-; its almost like... bittersweet in a way? And I appreciate that love isnt some automatic cure, but it certainly helps make everything a little bit better (and I hope one day you (really, all of us lmao) get an lxc of your own)
I'm sorry that you had such a bad day and I hope you feel better and that venting like this helped some <3 it's okay to not know who you are, and to take some time to try to establish who you want to be and what you want from life, away from the influences of other people, including your parents and those you want to please (and trying to come to terms with the fact that you being happy and satisfied and content is more important than making everyone else around you happy and trying to make them proud of you, and that there are ppl in your life who love you regardless of what you can do for them and will be proud of you for finding yourself(I... haven't quite achieved this lol))
Stay healthy and safe! I hope you have a better day today :)
Also I love Over and epik high omg and it suits jc so well?? I never realized wow",0,,

"Awww very sweet ending, loved this! Thanks so much for sharing~!",0,,
"oh!!!!!!
this really had an interesting writing style and sequences, and i do feel really intrigued by this plot and the way it was written out.

and the ending!!!
it really hit the peak!!",0,,
"This is very poignant. He starts out trying to undo what he did then just finds himself doing his best to get home to the person who matters most. And all the versions he meets, just as tragic, make him more determined. Love it.",0,,
"This is so terribly, hauntingly beautiful. I love this to absolute pieces. I love the open ending, how over time Wei Wuxian slowly comes to realise that even if they can not live what they had dreamt of, what they felt for each other won't be devalued and remains just as precious.

There are so many brilliant phrases here. Your writing style is lovely. But especially the two ending lines of each of the quote-styled portions. All of them are amazing. Thank you so much for this gem of a piece.",0,,
Aww the dimension hopping one!,0,,

SCREAMS THE DAD-SON RECONCILATION IS AMAZING JDJDJDJDDHDHDDB

i love this so much!!!!!!!!!",0,,
"This was beautiful and and I'm glad that LXC joined forces with WWX and JFM.

This is the only JFM that I like, other than that the canon JFM can go fuck himself.

Take care, drink some water, and have a nicd day/night!!",0,,
"I had SO MUCH fun with this, and I love how you closed it. Full circle.
People hate JFM? I haven't been that long in the fandom so I wouldn't know. It seems rather unfair, I mean obviously he had his flaws but I don't think he is hateful. Besides, a common theme in mxtx's works is that flaws are inevitable in anyone",0,,
"I literally laughed out loud several times while reading this, I think it cured my depression. 💖💖💖",0,,
Oh this is too wonderful AND THE ENDING..???? THAT PHONE CALL?? HAHAHAHA ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! What a good ending hahahahahaha thank you for this!!! I had so so so much fun reading this,0,,
